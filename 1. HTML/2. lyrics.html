        <h1>Tennessee Whiskey.</h1>

        <h3>Chris Stapleton.</h3>

        <hr/>

        <p>
            <h3>[Verse 1] <br> </h3>

            Used to spend my nights out in a barroom<br>
            Liquor was the only love I'd known<br>
            But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom<br>
            And brought me back from bein' too far gone<br>
        

    
            <h3>[Chorus] <br> </h3>

            You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey <br>
            You're as sweet as strawberry wine <br>
            You're as warm as a glass of brandy <br>
            And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time <br>
        

            <h3> [Verse 2] <br> </h3>

            I've looked for love in all the same old places <br>
            Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry <br>
            But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it <br>
            'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high <br>
        

        
            <h4> [Guitar Solo] <br> </h4>
        

        
            <h3>[Chorus] <br> </h3>

            And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br>
            You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br>
            You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br>
            And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time <br>
        

        
            <h3>[Outro] <br> </h3>
            
            You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey <br>
            Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey <br>
            You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey <br>
            Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey <br>
        </p>
